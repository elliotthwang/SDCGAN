# DCGAN-Sentence
This is a sentence generater
using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) (http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434).
A sentence is represented as sentence-image with shape (`vector_size` x `max_sentence_length` x `1`) (like CxHxW), which is ordered concatenation of word vectors.

This needs dataset of many sentences and pretrained word vectors.

This is derived from [mattya/chainer-DCGAN](https://github.com/mattya/chainer-DCGAN). Thank you!, mattya!
